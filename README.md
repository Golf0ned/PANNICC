Due to the pedagogical nature of this project, pull requests by users other than @golf0ned will most likely be closed.

With that being said, you are free to submit any issues or bug reports that you may encounter on GitHub.

If you still wish to submit changes anyways, there is a git hook to enforce formatting. You can install it with:
